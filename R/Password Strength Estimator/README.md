# What is zxcvbn?
As presented in the original repository (<a href="https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn">HERE</a>):

"<code>zxcvbn</code> is a password strength estimator inspired by password crackers. Through pattern matching and conservative estimation, it recognizes and weighs 30k common
passwords, common names and surnames according to US census data, popular English words from Wikipedia and US television and movies, and other common patterns like dates, repeats
(<code>aaa</code>), sequences (<code>abcd</code>), keyboard patterns (<code>qwertyuiop</code>), and l33t speak."

# Who is the original creator?
<code>Dropbox Inc.</code> created and made available the underlying code as a low-budget password strength estimator. If you are curious on how it was developed, the underlying
paper and presentation were made available at the 25th USENIX Security Symposium (available 
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/wheeler">HERE</a>).
