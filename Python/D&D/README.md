# Purpose of this program
Provide a simpler method to fill in the character sheet PDF provided by the authors of Spheres of Power and Might (D&D 5th Edition).

# Dependencies
Spheres_of_Power_and_Might_(5th_Edition)_Character_Sheet.pdf (also available at the same location as the executable).

# Additional information
This Character Generator is not built as a full standalone executable, meaning that you will still need to change/add things to the PDF manually.
